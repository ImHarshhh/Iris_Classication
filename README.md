# Iris_Classication

This repository contains a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into three species based on the size of their petals and sepals, as well as their widths.

## Data Exploration 

The dataset was thoroughly visualized to gain insights into the relationships between the features and the target variable. This step was crucial in identifying the most informative features and understanding the underlying patterns in the data.

## Model Development 

Multiple machine learning models were trained and compared to determine the best approach for this classification task. After evaluating the performance of each model, the chosen model achieved an impressive accuracy score of 98.3%.

The model takes in the following features as input:

* Petal length
* Petal width
* Sepal length
* Sepal width

and outputs the predicted species of the iris flower.

## Results 

The final model demonstrates exceptional performance, accurately classifying iris flowers with a high degree of precision. The code and dataset are provided for further exploration and improvement.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
